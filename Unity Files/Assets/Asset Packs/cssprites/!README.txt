CyberShield Sprites
by XCVG

Enemy, weapon, and effect sprites from my jam game, CyberShield. These are named and formatted to work with ZDoom but of course will work anywhere a 2D graphic will. The palette is almost, but not quite, DB32, though the files are truecolor. Most are not power-of-two and would need to be resized or padded if that is required.

I'd like it if you credited me (XCVG) and threw in a link to my website (xcvgsystems.com) and/or mentioned that you used sprites from CyberShield (https://xcvg.itch.io/cybershield), but you are under no obligation to do so.
